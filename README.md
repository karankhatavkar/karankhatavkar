## Hey there! I'm Karan.

### About Me

I'm on an exhilarating journey of exploring new technologies and crafting innovative software solutions. I'm particularly enthusiastic about the exciting world of IoT, where devices, sensors, and software come together to create magic in our everyday lives. I completed my B.Tech degree at MIT World Peace University, Pune, India in 2022. Today, I'm fortunate to be a part of the dynamic tech world, working as a Software Developer at Amdocs.

Currently, I'm on a quest to expand my horizons even further. I'm diving deep into the realms of Cloud Architecture and Machine Learning, two captivating fields that promise to reshape our digital landscape. Learning, for me, is a never-ending journey, and I can't wait to see where these new technologies will take me.

When I'm not coding or delving into the intricacies of tech, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, diving into a good book, or experimenting with my latest IoT projects. I believe that the future is in the hands of those who dare to dream, innovate, and embrace change.
